Overview
This smart contract implements a decentralized listing and bidding system for items on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows sellers to list items for sale and buyers to bid on them, with built-in escrow functionality and delivery tracking.

Contract Architecture
Data Structures
solidity
struct Item {
    string name;           // Name/description of the item
    uint listingPrice;     // Minimum price set by seller
    bool sold;             // Whether item has been sold
    bool sent;             // Whether seller has sent the item
    bool received;         // Whether buyer has received the item
    address seller;        // Address of the seller
}

struct Buyer {
    address addr;          // Address of the highest bidder
    uint biddingPrice;     // Current highest bid
}
Functions
1. Constructor
solidity
constructor(string memory _name, uint _listingPrice)
Purpose: Initializes the listing when the contract is deployed

Parameters:

_name: Name/description of the item

_listingPrice: Minimum price for the item

Initializes:

Sets seller to contract deployer

Resets buyer to zero address

2. Bid Function
solidity
function bid() external payable
Allows users to bid on the item

Requirements:

Bid amount ≥ listing price

Item not already sold

Bid higher than current highest bid

Features:

Automatically refunds previous highest bidder

Updates highest bidder and bid amount

3. End Bidding
solidity
function endBidding() external
Requirements:

Caller must be the seller

At least one bid must exist

Item not already marked as sold

Effect: Marks the item as sold, finalizing the auction

4. Delivery Tracking
solidity
function itemSent() external
function itemRecieved() external
itemSent():

Can only be called by seller

Requires item to be sold

Marks item as shipped

itemRecieved():

Can only be called by buyer

Requires item to be marked as sent

Marks item as received

Automatically releases payment to seller

5. View Functions
solidity
function getName() public view returns(string memory)
function isSent() public view returns(bool)
function isRecieved() public view returns(bool)
function getBuyer() public view returns(address)
function getPrice() public view returns(uint)
getName(): Returns item name

isSent(): Returns whether item has been shipped

isRecieved(): Returns whether buyer has received item

getBuyer(): Returns buyer's address (only if sold)

getPrice(): Returns current price (listing price if no bids, otherwise highest bid)

Workflow
Normal Flow
Deploy Contract: Seller deploys with item details and minimum price

Bidding Phase: Buyers place bids (must exceed current highest bid)

End Bidding: Seller finalizes auction when ready

Item Sent: Seller marks item as shipped

Item Received: Buyer confirms receipt, triggering payment release

Bid Refund Flow
When a new higher bid is placed:

Previous bidder automatically gets refunded

New bidder becomes the highest bidder
